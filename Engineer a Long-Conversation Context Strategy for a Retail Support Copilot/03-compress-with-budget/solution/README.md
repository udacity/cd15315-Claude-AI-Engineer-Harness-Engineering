# Retail Customer Support Context Strategy

**Course:** Claude Certified Architect — Foundations / Course 1, Harness Engineering
**Module:** 2 — Context Engineering Foundations
**Status:** Solution exemplar
**Build:** Python 3.10+, `anthropic` SDK, runs in Docker with `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

This is the reference solution. The system designs a context-management strategy for a 48-turn retail customer-support conversation that spans three issues — a refund inquiry (resolved), a subscription cancellation (resolved), and a payment-method update (active). The raw transcript is ~35,000 tokens; the assembled context is **the project's measurable output**, recorded in `runs/<run_id>/context.md` alongside `budget.json` (token accounting) and `eval.jsonl` (evaluation results against the compressed context).

The defining architectural choice is **application-side context engineering**: the harness owns the assembly, compression, and pruning decisions, not the model. This is the pattern to apply for context engineering ("trim verbose tool outputs … *before they accumulate in context*"). The cookbook labs demonstrate the *server-side* counterpart (`clear_tool_uses_20250919`, `compact_20260112`) — see "What I'd do next" below for the contrast.

## Context-window anatomy

<!-- TODO (Exercise 4): Replace this section with the five-layer context-window
     anatomy diagram (system prompt → CLAUDE.md → memory → conversation history
     → current turn) AND a one-paragraph note locating *this project's* work on
     one specific layer. The diagram can be ASCII or Mermaid — the point is
     that a reviewer can read a labeled box and find the corresponding section
     of `runs/<id>/context.md`. -->

## Why this layout?

<!-- TODO (Exercise 4): Replace this section with 3-5 sentences naming WHY
     case facts sit at the top, resolved summaries sit in the middle, and the
     active segment sits verbatim at the bottom. Cite at minimum:
       (a) the "lost in the middle" attention effect,
       (b) the resolved-vs-active fidelity tradeoff, and
       (c) the pass-complete-history baseline this project deliberately deviates
           from (only for resolved threads, where coherence is no longer load-
           bearing). The "scratchpad" synonym for the case-facts block is worth
           naming. -->

## Before / after token budget

<!-- TODO (Exercise 4): Replace this section with a one-line statement of the
     token-counting methodology actually used (sourced from `tokens.methodology()`
     and recorded in `budget.json`), followed by a Markdown table populated from
     `runs/<id>/budget.json` showing per-section + assembled total + baseline +
     reduction-percentage. The table is *sourced from* `budget.json`, not
     narrated — anyone re-running the pipeline should regenerate the same table
     (modulo a few percent of drift if the Anthropic endpoint is used). -->

## Eval results

Six questions span all three issues. Pass threshold ≥ 5/6 against the assembled context. A control variant strips the case-facts block; at least one of Q1/Q6 must fail in the control, proving the block carries information the summaries don't.

From `runs/20260519-124910/eval.jsonl`:

| # | Question (source) | Result | Model answer (excerpt) |
|---|---|:-:|---|
| Q1 | Actual refund amount for ORD-77310? (case facts) | ✅ | "...processed for order ORD-77310 was **$22.14**..." |
| Q2 | Why did the customer cancel their subscription? (subscription summary) | ✅ | "...due to a **duplicate charge**..." |
| Q3 | Failure code on the current payment-method update? (active verbatim) | ✅ | "...is **AVS_MISMATCH**..." |
| Q4 | Last-4 of the new card the customer is trying to add? (active verbatim) | ✅ | "...are **7782**..." |
| Q5 | Did the customer receive their subscription proration refund? (subscription summary) | ✅ | "...not yet... processed and initiated, but not yet received..." |
| Q6 | Structured status of the payment-method update issue? (case facts) | ✅ | "...the structured status token... is `in_progress`..." |
|   | **Total** | **6/6** |   |

**Control variant** (case-facts block stripped, Q1 + Q6 only):

| # | Result | Notes |
|---|:-:|---|
| Q1 | ✅ (unexpected pass) | The refund summary preserved `$22.14` verbatim, so the answer is still recoverable without the case-facts block. |
| Q6 | ❌ (expected fail) | The structured token `in_progress` appears only in the case-facts block; the active verbatim describes the state in prose ("still trying to figure out...") but never uses the snake_case status token. This is the strict load-bearing demonstration. |

The mixed control result is honest about how compression works in practice: when the summarizer preserves a numeric value (Q1), the case-facts block becomes a *cheaper* path to the same answer rather than the *only* path. Q6 demonstrates the strict case — case-facts is the only source of structured tokens.

See [`runs/20260519-124910/eval.jsonl`](runs/20260519-124910/eval.jsonl) and [`eval_control.jsonl`](runs/20260519-124910/eval_control.jsonl) for raw model answers.

## Quickstart

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Build the assembled context + run all evals + control:
python -m retail_context.run --all

# Build the assembled context only (no eval calls):
python -m retail_context.run --build

# Try a stronger summarization model (any model id your key accepts; in a
# Udacity lab, `echo $ANTHROPIC_MODELS` lists them):
python -m retail_context.run --all --model <model-id>
```

Artifacts land in `runs/<run_id>/`:
- `context.md`         — the assembled context (read this first)
- `budget.json`        — token accounting + methodology
- `case_facts_call.json` — LLM call log for case-facts extraction
- `eval.jsonl`         — per-question results
- `eval_control.jsonl` — control variant (Q1, Q6 with case facts stripped)

## What I'd do next

- **Session resumption** — when the same customer returns 4 hours later, do we reload the verbatim active segment or re-extract case facts and start fresh? The case-facts block is the right *durable* artifact to carry across `--resume`; the verbatim active section becomes stale (tool results referenced by turn-id may have expired in the backend).

- **Server-side context editing** is the modern API-level alternative this project deliberately does not use. The Anthropic Messages API exposes:
  - **`clear_tool_uses_20250919`** (beta `context-management-2025-06-27`) — drops stale tool-result blocks server-side, transparent to the model. Preferable to this project's `pruner.py` when the *whole tool result* can be dropped (vs preserving 5 of 40 fields).
  - **`compact_20260112`** (beta `compact-2026-01-12`) — server-side rolling compression of old turns. Preferable to this project's resolved-segment summarizer when the cutoff between "compressible" and "not" is *temporal* rather than *issue-based*.
  Application-side pruning (this project) wins when (a) the field-level keep-set is decision-specific, (b) the resolved-vs-active boundary is semantic, not chronological, or (c) you need the auditable artifact (`context.md`) for compliance review. Server-side editing wins on simplicity and zero application-layer state.

- **"Lost in the middle" negative variant** — re-run eval against an assembled context where the case-facts block is placed in the middle instead of the top. If Q1 and Q6 degrade, the position effect is empirically demonstrated, not just diagrammed.

- **Summarize the active segment too** — a stand-out experiment that demonstrates the fidelity-loss the verbatim choice avoids. Run Q3 and Q4 against a context where the active segment was *also* run through the compressor.
